[ ] integrate UE implementation using Battery-less Node for Energy-harvesting IoT model from Capuzzo et al., 2021  
  - [repository](https://github.com/signetlabdei/capacitor-ns3)
    
[ ] create a set of nodes (1 eNB + "x" UE)  

  - Use at first similar setup as Mitsiou et al., 2023
  - We can evolve to a more complex setup as in Gharbieh et al., 2021
  
[ ] merge with batteryless simulation  

[ ] we have only one datasource with harvest energy. how do we apply that to several nodes?
